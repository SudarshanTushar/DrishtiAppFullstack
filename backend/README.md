# 🚁 DRISHTI: Disaster Response & Intelligence System

> *Survive. Connect. Recover.*

![Drishti Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=DRISHTI+DASHBOARD)

## 🚨 The Problem
During floods (like Sikkim 2023), standard communication fails within **4 hours**.
* **No Internet:** Victims cannot send SOS.
* **No Data:** Rescue teams work blindly.
* **No Coordination:** Government relies on outdated manual reports.

## ⚡ The Solution: Drishti
A fully offline-capable ecosystem that combines **Mesh Networking**, **AI Prediction**, and **Government Governance**.


## 🎮 HOW TO DEMO (SIMULATION MODE)
We have built a "God Mode" to demonstrate the system without waiting for a real disaster.

1.  **Open the Admin Dashboard** (Desktop View).
    * Login: `admin` / `india123`
2.  **Trigger Disaster:**
    * Click the **"⚠️ START SIM"** button in the top right.
    * *Effect:* The Map turns RED, and a "Pending Decision" appears.
3.  **Governance Layer:**
    * You will see an **"ACTION REQUIRED"** panel.
    * This proves AI *cannot* act alone. A human must **APPROVE** the evacuation order.
4.  **Resolve:**
    * Click **"AUTHORIZE"**.
    * The system dispatches alerts and resets to green.
